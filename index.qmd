  Focal adhesions mediate the interaction of the cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix (ECM).
  Cell-ECM adhesion is used by almost all cells both during development and homeostasis and ranges from dynamic to permanent.
  As such, it is an important process in health and disease alike.
  Talin is a central regulator and adaptorprotein of the multiprotein focal adhesion complexes and is responsible for integrin activation and force-sensing.
  We evaluated direct interactions of talin with the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP~2~) by means of molecular dynamics simulations.
  A newly published autoinhibitory structure of talin, where common PIP~2~ interaction sites are covered up, sparked our curiosity for a hitherto less examined loop as a potential site of first contact.
  We show that this unstructured loop in the F1 subdomain of the talin1 FERM domain is able to interact with PIP~2~ and can facilitate further interactions by serving as a flexible membrane anchor.
  This work presents the dynamics of the interaction and identifies key residues.
  Further, we surveyed the effect of a physiological PIP~2~ enrichment at focal adhesion sites on the dynamics of talin through force-probe molecular dynamics simulations.
  The results provide backing for the direct involvement of PIP~2~ in the localization and activation of talin.

# Introduction

It is critical for cells to mechanically
sense their surroundings at cell adhesion sites for a multitude
of biological processes.
Contact with the extracellular matrix and surrounding cells regulates growth, differentiation,
motility and even apoptosis [@vogelLocalForceGeometry2006; @oakesStressingLimitsFocal2014; @schillerMechanosensitivityCompositionalDynamics2013; @miroshnikovaAdhesionForcesCortical2018].
The multiprotein focal adhesion complex is responsible for translating
between biochemical and mechanical signals, where both directions,
outside--in and inside--out activation, are being investigated [@thamilselvanPressureActivatesColon2004; @pelletierActivationStateIntegrin1995].

At the center of the focal adhesion complex sits the adaptorprotein talin,
which dynamically unfolds and refolds under force [@yaoMechanicalResponseTalin2016].
A schematic of Talin can be seen in @fig-tln-schema-long.
Through interaction with integrin tails (dark green),
which in turn interact with collagen fibers via their heads,
it links the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton
by directly interacting with acting and increasing integrins
affinity for ligands, thereby activating it [@tadokoroTalinBindingIntegrin2003].

Talin features an N-terminal FERM domain (F for 4.1 protein, E for ezrin, R for radixin and M for moesin) which provides the link to the cystosolic
side of the plasma membrane [@chishtiFERMDomainUnique1998].
It does so via a conserved binding motif for
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP~2~),
which is enriched at active focal adhesion sites [@maniFERMDomainPhosphoinositide2011; @dasMolecularMechanotransductionPathway2015; @songNovelMembranedependentSwitch2012a].
In the figures we color the individual subdomains F0-F3.
The main binding sites in F2 and F3 are highlighted with red spheres.
Notably, the Talin1 FERM domain differs from other FERM proteins through
the addition of the F0 subdomain, which is connected to F1 via a charged interface,
as well as an insert in F1, a flexible loop with helical propensity and basic residues [@goultStructureDoubleUbiquitinlike2010].
Additionally, it exists in an extended conformation, as opposed to the cloverleaf-like
conformation of other FERM proteins [@elliottStructureTalinHead2010].
F3 also has a binding site for $\beta$-integrin tails [@calderwoodTalinHeadDomain1999] and is partly responsible for the enrichment of PIP~2~ at the membrane through a binding site
for PIPKI$\gamma$ [@calderwoodTalinsKindlinsPartners2013].
A second integrin binding site is located with the rod domains 11 (R11) [@horwitzInteractionPlasmaMembrane1986].
On the other hand talin interacts with the cytoskeleton through
actin binding sites (F2-F3, R4-R8, R13-DH) [@mccannLWEQModuleConserved1997].
The review by Klapholz et al. [@klapholzTalinMasterIntegrin2017] provides.
An excellent overview of the many interaction sites of talin
and its central role in the focal adhesion complex.

It was previously shown that F3 can interact with R9, which hinders integrin
activation [@bannoSubcellularLocalizationTalin2012]
and recently Dedden et al. [@deddenArchitectureTalin1Reveals2019a]
published a novel cryo-Electron Microscopy structure of
the autoinhibited Talin1.
They showed that the rod domains R9 and R12 shield the
established PIP~2~ binding surface and the integrin binding
site in F3.
This beckons the question how this autoinhibition can be resolved.
Song at al. [@songNovelMembranedependentSwitch2012a]
had previously investigated a fragment of talin consisting of F2-F3 and an
inhibiting rod segment and suggested a pull-push mechanism,
whereby negatively charged PIP~2~ attracts its positively
charged binding surface on F2-F3 and simultaneously
repels the negatively charged surface of the inhibitive rod segment.
However, this still leaves open the question of how
talin can establish a first contact with the membrane
and remain within a sufficient proximity for this effect to kick in.

A schematic overview of Talin and our simulation setup.
**a\)** A schematic rendering of full-length Talin over a POPC membrane enriched with PIP~2~ in the upper leaflet.
The subdomains under scrutiny in this publication,
namely F0-F3, which comprise the N-terminal FERM domain (or talin head)
are highlighted in pastel colors (green, cyan, yellow, magenta).
The two major PIP~2~ binding sites in F2-F3 are marked with red spheres.
An integrin binding site also resides in this area.
Klapholz et al. [@klapholzTalinMasterIntegrin2017] provide
an excellent review of Talin's central role in the focal adhesion
complex and list further binding sites.
The talin rod segments (or talin tail) are numbered R1 to R13.
Note, that under physiological conditions with talin experiencing force
from bound actin the angle between the FERM domain and the talin rod
would be more akin to 30° as opposed to the linear structure used here
for illustrative purposes.
Tails of an integrin $\alpha$ and $\beta$ heterodimer
reaching through the lipid bilayer are represented in green.
**b\)** A schematic rendering of the autoinhibited structure of Talin
as crystallized by Dedden et al. [@deddenArchitectureTalin1Reveals2019a]
in combination with a cartoon representation in **c)**.
The completed FERM structure by Elliott et al. [@elliottStructureTalinHead2010],
with our addition of the modelled F1 loop,
is fitted to the autoinhibited structure,
as the latter does not include F0-F1 due to their flexibility.
The main PIP~2~-binding sites in F2-F3 are occluded by rod domain 12
Additionally, R9 covers up the integrin binding site.
::::

In order to investigate this we looked at the additional
flexible F1 loop, which had been shown to be important
for talin mediated integrin activation [@goultStructureDoubleUbiquitinlike2010],
but was only considered a minor PIP~2~ binding site
compared to the main site in F2-F3 [@chinthalapudiInteractionTalinCell2018a; @saltelNewPIP22009].

Due to its high flexibility, the loop itself is not included
in crystal structures of the FERM domain,
such as PDB-ID 3IVF by Elliot et al. [@elliottStructureTalinHead2010].
Its high flexibility however also gave use the confidence to
model it from sequence.
The retained flexibility in equilibrium simulations (@fig-loop-rmsf)
as well as comparisons to NMR structures
[@goultStructureDoubleUbiquitinlike2010] confirmed this approach.

With a complete structure of the talin FERM domain
we investigated the role of the F1 loop through molecular
dynamics simulations.
By taking a closer look at just F0-F1, we first
show that the loop has a clear propensity to interact with
the PIP~2~-containing membrane
and is able to establish a first contact with it even from 
unfavorable initial conformations due to its large search volume.
Furthermore, we show with simulations of the full-length FERM
domain that once the loop has established an initial contact, it
can anchor the FERM domain to the membrane and re-establish
the known major binding sites in F2-F3.

:::

The missing F1 domain loop between residues L133 and W144 was modeled using MODELLER [@marti-renomComparativeProteinStructure2000; @webbComparativeProteinStructure2016] via the interface to Chimera [@pettersenUCSFChimeraVisualization2004], followed by equilibration with GROMACS.
The resulting conformation was compared to an NMR structure of the F1 domain (PDB-ID 2KC2) by Goult et al. [@goultStructureDoubleUbiquitinlike2010].

The missing residue M1 was also added.
The missing residues I399 and L400 where not modeled, leaving us with with a continuous sequence from residue 1 to 398.
Simulations where performed with the CHARM36 force field.
Topologies, including the membrane, where generated with the CHARM-GUI web app [@brooksCHARMMBiomolecularSimulation2009; @joCHARMMGUIWebbasedGraphical2008; @leeCHARMMGUIInputGenerator2016] and GROMACS tools. All simulations used the TIP3P water model and where neutralized with 0.15 mol/L of NaCl. A 6-step equilibration was performed after gradient decent energy minimization while gradually relieving restraints on protein and membrane atoms. Production runs use a timestep of 2 fs, a Verlet cut-off scheme for Van-der-Waals interactions and the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method for long-range electrostatics. NTP-ensembles where achieved by Nosé-Hoover temperature coupling [@hooverCanonicalDynamicsEquilibrium1985; @noseUnifiedFormulationConstant1984] and Parinello-Rahman pressure coupling [@parrinelloPolymorphicTransitionsSingle1981].
An example `.mdp`-file can be found in the supplementary materials at @sec-prod-mdp.

The initial equilibrium simulation of the completed FERM domain was run for 75 ns.
Subsequently, the root mean squared fluctuation (RMSF) was calculated with GROMACS tools.

The F0F1 FERM sub domains (residues 1 to 197) were simulated to evaluate protein-membrane association using a rotational sampling approach.
This entailed placing the protein 1.5 nm away from a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membrane in a total of 60 orientations spanning a rotation of 360 degrees.
6 replicates of each orientation where run for 200\ ns each.
However, due to a hardware failure, 6 of these 360 runs are only 50 to 150\ ns long.
Of the 119 lipids in the upper leaflet of the POPC membrane, 12 lipids were replaced with PIP~2~, which results in a physiological concentration of 10% PIP~2~.

From this rotational sampling,
we selected representative conformations with high protein-membrane interaction as the basis of 6 equilibrium simulations of the complete FERM domain over a POPC membrane with 26 PIP~2~ lipids out of a total of 273 lipids in the upper leaflet.
Each simulation ran for 400\ ns.
The initial conformations for perpendicular pulling simulations of the F0F1
subdomains to gauge interaction strength where also chose from the rotational sampling set.

To compare the effects of PIP~2~ on the dynamics, a system containing only 1\ %\ PIP~2~ (3 PIP~2~ molecules in 273 lipids) was created from the enriched system by programmatically exchanging lipid head groups via a python script.
The enriched and non-enriched systems where then subjected to force-probe MD simulations.

# Results

## The F1 loop can act as a point of first contact

<!-- TODO: axis label in E should be time not frame -->

When simulating F0-F1 over a POPC membrane containing 10% PIP~2~
we noticed that the F1 loop had a clear propensity to establish
contact with the membrane.
And once contact had been established the protein was
anchored strongly enough for more contacts to evolve
with time, pulling the protein onto the membrane ([see Figure @fig-f0f1-unbound; -@fig-f0f1-anchored; -@fig-f0f1-bound]).
In order to control for a potential bias towards the loop as a result
of the starting position we performed a rotational sampling
of the system, where the starting angle of the loop
with respect to the membrane was varied across 60 equally spaced angles.
@fig-f0f1-ri-angle shows that independent of the starting
position, the loop is able to find the membrane and bind to it,
though this does happen earlier in the simulation when the loop starts
favorably oriented towards the membrane (@fig-f0f1-angle-frame).
However, even in its most unfavorable starting orientation
(180°, oriented away from the membrane) the loop is able to find
the membrane due to the large search space it can cover with
its high flexibility (see @fig-loop-rmsf).

Once contact has been made,
it becomes exceedingly unlikely for F0-F1 to dissociate from the membrane (@fig-f0f1-retention).
Of 358 runs ^[6 replicas each for 60 angles minus 2 runs lost to a storage failure],
89 runs never made contact with the membrane, but
out of the 269 that did, only 10 eventually dissociated.
@fig-f0f1-ri-npip and @fig-f0f1-residues highlight the residues 
involved in the interaction.

Rotational sampling of F0-F1.
**a-c\)**
Snapshots from a simulation involving F0-F1 over a POPC membrane
containing 10% PIP~2~ in the upper leaflet.
POPC is not rendered and PIP~2~ is shown as light grey stick models
that turn thicker for those molecules that are currently interacting
with residues of the protein.
Those residues are then shown as dark blue stick models.
Once the F1 loop has made contact with the membrane it can act as an anchor
and facilitate further contacts, ultimately pulling the
protein onto the membrane.
In order to test if this interaction of the loop with the membrane
is just the result of a biased starting position with the loop already
pointing downwards,
we sampled 60 different starting positions,
rotated equally spaced around the horizontal axis,
with 6 replicates each.
**d\)**
A heatmap summarizing 358 simulations from the rotational sampling.
Unfortunately the number is not 360 because 2 trajectories
where lost due to a hardware failure.
Each simulation is 200\ ns long.
Across all angles (y-axis) we see that with very
few exceptions the F1 loop (dark blue region on the x-axis colorbar)
is almost always involved in interactions. 0° equates to the loop
pointing downwards towards the membrane.
The heatmap color represents the mean number of PIP~2~ molecules
that are in close contact with the respective residue summarized
over time and replicates for that specific angle.
**e\)**
A heatmap of the time evolution of the number of PIP~2~ molecules
at the respective time and angle summarized over all residues and replicates.
Angles in which the loop is already favored towards the membrane
tend to make contact faster. Note, that this trend
is not simply because angles favoring the loop would have been
already closer to the membrane.
The protein was rotated in such a way that the respective closest residue
had the same distance to the membrane for the 0° and the 180° starting positions.
**f\)**
A time evolution of the simulations shows the number of interacting
residues gradually increasing as the anchored protein gets pulled
closer towards the membrane by the forming interactions.
Only in 10 simulations (out of 269 simulations that had at least one contact)
did the protein leave the membrane again within the 200\ ns long timeframe.
This never occurred after more than 3 residues had already made contact.
**g\)**
The Mean interaction scores of the individual residues across all simulations that
made contact with the membrane.
Color represents the isoelectric point of the amino acid in isolation (blue = basic, magenta = acidic).
A number of very prominent lysines can be observed, as well as
a cluster of residues belonging to the F1 loop.
The most prominent residues are highlighted in **h)**.
:::::

## The F1 loop can facilitate further contacts

We chose a representative conformation from the rotational
sampling as a starting point for force-probe simulations
of F0-F1 perpendicular to the membrane (@fig-f0f1-vert-pull-vmd) to test the strength
of the interaction.
An exemplary render of one of the simulations can be seen in @fig-f0f1-pull-run-1.
Pulling F0-F1 off the membrane requires peak forces of 100--120\ pN,
during which the interacting residues only very gradually loose contact (@fig-f0f1-vert-pull).
This highlights the strong anchoring capabilities of the loop.
Its high flexibility allows it the remain in contact with the membrane
over large distances, which would allow for a spring-like re-establishing
of more contacts should the force be alleviated.

Vertical Pulling of F0-F1.
**a\)**
A representative render of one of 6 force-probe MD simulations pulling
F0-F1 off the membrane.
It starts from a snapshot of F0-F1 in its bound conformation taken
from the rotational sampling (@fig-loop-importance) and gets pulled
upwards from its C-terminus.
The direction of force is shown in the snapshot **b\)**.
**c\)**
As F0-F1 gets pulled at a constant rate of 0.03\ nm/ns we
observe the time evolution of the force (bottom panel) and
the number of interacting residues (top panel).
The number of interacting residues goes down very gradually,
as the high flexibility of loop allows the residues to remain
in contact even as the distance increases.
::::

Simulations with the full-length FERM domain show
that with the loop as an initial membrane contact,
known PIP~2~ binding sites can also be established as well ([@fig-ferm-ri-npip; @fig-ferm-memb-system]).
The highlighted residues include K272 of F2 and K316, K324, E342, and K343 of F3, which have been shown to be crucial for the membrane interaction of Talin and subsequent integrin activation by Chinthalapudi et al. [@chinthalapudiInteractionTalinCell2018a].
