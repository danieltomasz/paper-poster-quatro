  abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

  abstract = {Collective movement of epithelial cells drives essential multicellular organization during various fundamental physiological processes encompassing embryonic morphogenesis, cancer and wound healing. Yet the molecular mechanism that ensures the coordinated movement of many cells remains elusive. Here we show that a tumour suppressor protein, merlin, coordinates collective migration of tens of cells, by acting as a mechanochemical transducer. In a stationary epithelial monolayer and also in three-dimensional human skin, merlin localizes to cortical cell\textendash cell junctions. During migration initiation, a fraction of cortical merlin relocalizes to the cytoplasm. This relocalization is triggered by the intercellular pulling force of the leading cell and depends on the actomyosin-based cell contractility. Then in migrating cells, taking its cue from the intercellular pulling forces, which show long-distance ordering, merlin coordinates polarized Rac1 activation and lamellipodium formation on the multicellular length scale. Together, these results provide a distinct molecular mechanism linking intercellular forces to collective cell movements in migrating epithelia.},

Talin is an integrin-activating and tension-sensing FA component directly connecting integrins in the plasma membrane with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. To understand how talin function is regulated, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of full-length talin1 revealing a two-way mode of autoinhibition. The actin-binding rod domains fold into a 15-nm globular arrangement that is interlocked by the integrin-binding FERM head. In turn, the rod domains R9 and R12 shield access of the FERM domain to integrin and the phospholipid PIP\textsubscript{2} at the membrane. This mechanism likely ensures synchronous inhibition of integrin, membrane, and cytoskeleton binding. We also demonstrate that compacted talin1 reversibly unfolds to an {$\sim$}60-nm string-like conformation, revealing interaction sites for vinculin and actin. Our data explain how fast switching between active and inactive conformations of talin could regulate FA turnover, a process critical for cell adhesion and signaling.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The crystal structure of the N-terminal head of the integrin-associated cytoskeletal protein talin reported here reveals a novel FERM domain with a linear domain arrangement, plus an additional domain F0 packed against F1. While F3 binds {$\beta$}-integrin tails, basic residues in F1 and F2 are required for membrane association and for integrin activation. We show that these same residues are also required for cell spreading and focal adhesion assembly in cells. We suggest that the extended conformation of the talin head allows simultaneous binding to integrins via F3 and to PtdIns(4,5)P2-enriched microdomains via basic residues distributed along one surface of the talin head, and that these multiple interactions are required to stabilize integrins in the activated state.},

Although F3 contains the binding site for ?-integrin tails, F0 and F1 are also required for activation of ?1-integrins. Here, we report the solution structures of F0, F1 and of the F0F1 double domain. Both F0 and F1 have ubiquitin-like folds joined in a novel fixed orientation by an extensive charged interface. The F1 insert forms a loop with helical propensity, and basic residues predicted to reside on one surface of the helix are required for binding to acidic phospholipids and for talin-mediated activation of ?1-integrins. This and the fact that basic residues on F2 and F3 are also essential for integrin activation suggest that extensive interactions between the talin FERM domain and acidic membrane phospholipids are required to orientate the FERM domain such that it can activate integrins.},

Mechanical unfolding of proteins may trigger distinct downstream signals in cells, providing a mechanism for cellular mechanotransduction. Force-induced unfolding of talin, a prominent focal adhesion protein, has been demonstrated previously for a small portion of its rod domain. Here, using single-molecule atomic force microscopy (smAFM), we show that the entire talin rod can be unfolded by mechanical extension, over a physiological range of forces between 10 and 40 pN. We also demonstrate, through a combination of smAFM and steered molecular dynamics, that the different bundles within the talin rod exhibit a distinct hierarchy of mechanical stability. These results provide a mechanism by which different force conditions within the cell control a graduated unfolding of the talin rod. Mechanical unfolding of the rod subdomains, and the subsequent effect on talin's binding interactions, would allow for a finely tuned cellular response to internally or externally applied forces.},

We find the dynamical steady-state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, px, V, {$\epsilon\dot$}, and {$\zeta$}, where the x are reduced distances and the two variables {$\epsilon\dot$} and {$\zeta$} act as thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated. We illustrate the dynamical equations by considering their application to the simplest possible case, a one-dimensional classical harmonic oscillator.},

In this Review, we draw on experiments performed in mammalian cells in culture and Drosophila to present evidence that talin is the most important component of integrin adhesion complexes. We describe how the properties of this adaptor protein enable it to orchestrate integrin adhesions. Talin forms the core of integrin adhesion complexes by linking integrins directly to actin, increasing the affinity of integrin for ligands (integrin activation) and recruiting numerous proteins. It regulates the strength of integrin adhesion, senses matrix rigidity, increases focal adhesion size in response to force and serves as a platform for the building of the adhesion structure. Finally, the mechano-sensitive structure of talin provides a paradigm for how proteins transduce mechanical signals to chemical signals.},

  abstract = {Proper treatment of nonbonded interactions is essential for the accuracy of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, especially in studies of lipid bilayers. The use of the CHARMM36 force field (C36 FF) in different MD simulation programs can result in disagreements with published simulations performed with CHARMM due to differences in the protocols used to treat the long-range and 1-4 nonbonded interactions. In this study, we systematically test the use of the C36 lipid FF in NAMD, GROMACS, AMBER, OpenMM, and CHARMM/OpenMM. A wide range of Lennard-Jones (LJ) cutoff schemes and integrator algorithms were tested to find the optimal simulation protocol to best match bilayer properties of six lipids with varying acyl chain saturation and head groups. MD simulations of a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer were used to obtain the optimal protocol for each program. MD simulations with all programs were found to reasonably match the DPPC bilayer properties (surface area per lipid, chain order parameters, and area compressibility modulus) obtained using the standard protocol used in CHARMM as well as from experiments. The optimal simulation protocol was then applied to the other five lipid simulations and resulted in excellent agreement between results from most simulation programs as well as with experimental data. AMBER compared least favorably with the expected membrane properties, which appears to be due to its use of the hard-truncation in the LJ potential versus a force-based switching function used to smooth the LJ potential as it approaches the cutoff distance. The optimal simulation protocol for each program has been implemented in CHARMM-GUI. This protocol is expected to be applicable to the remainder of the additive C36 FF including the proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecules.},

The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

By quantifying and modelling tissue stress and deformation in the mammalian epidermis, we find that this balance is coordinated through local mechanical forces generated by cell division and delamination. Proliferation within the basal stem/progenitor layer, which displays features of a jammed, solid-like state, leads to crowding, thereby locally distorting cell shape and stress distribution. The resulting decrease in cortical tension and increased cell\textendash cell adhesion trigger differentiation and subsequent delamination, reinstating basal cell layer density. After delamination, cells establish a high-tension state as they increase myosin II activity and convert to E-cadherin-dominated adhesion, thereby reinforcing the boundary between basal and suprabasal layers. Our results uncover how biomechanical signalling integrates single-cell behaviours to couple proliferation, cell fate and positioning to generate a multilayered tissue.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Integrins bind extracellular matrix and transduce signals mediating cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. It is unclear how these distinct responses follow from a common event: integrin clustering. We examined the relationship between integrin-mediated signals and the integrin's activation state using a cell line expressing {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3} (Clone B) and a panel of monoclonal antibodies against this integrin. Nonactivating antibodies used to cluster {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3} stimulated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation, regardless of affinity, subunit specificity, or ligand-blocking phenotype. Coated on plastic, these antibodies supported cell adhesion, spreading, and FAK phosphorylation. In contrast, clustering of {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3} induced with activating antibodies, or binding of soluble fibrinogen to antibody-activated {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3}, did not induce FAK phosphorylation. Thus, clustering of {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3} on Clone B does not necessarily result in FAK phosphorylation. Coated on plastic, activating antibodies supported cell adhesion, but not spreading or FAK phosphorylation. Therefore, it appears the resting, not the active form of {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3}, induces cell spreading and FAK phosphorylation in Clone B. These data indicate that "inside-out" signals may alter not only the binding specificity of an integrin, but the "outside-in" biochemical signals that integrin initiates as well. This activation state-linked signaling represents a novel mechanism, which may explain how diverse cellular responses are induced by integrin-matrix interactions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The formation of cell?matrix adhesions and integrin signalling involves the dynamic recruitment and assembly of an inventory of proteins, collectively termed the ?adhesome?, at the adhesive site. The recruitment of some adhesome proteins, most notably the Lin11-, Isl1- and Mec3-domain-containing proteins, depends on mechanical tension generated by myosin II-mediated contractile forces exerted on cell?matrix adhesions. When exposed to force, mechanosensitive adhesome proteins can change their conformation or expose cryptic-binding sites leading to the recruitment of proteins, rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, reinforcement of the adhesive site and signal transduction. Biophysical methods and proteomics revealed force ranges within the adhesome and cytoskeleton, and also force-dependent changes in adhesome composition. In this review, we provide an overview of the compositional dynamics of cell?matrix adhesions, discuss the most prevalent functional domains in adhesome proteins and review literature and concepts about mechanosensing mechanisms that operate at the adhesion site.},

We inhibited Src (PP2), FAK (small RNA interference, SiRNA, or FRNK transfection), MEK (PD98059), PKC (calphostin C), and actin destabilization (phalloidin). Results: Pressure and manganese stimulated primary and SW620 colonocyte adhesion to collagen. Pressure also stimulated SW620 adhesion to endothelial monolayers. Pressure strengthened SW620 binding force to matrix without changing integrin surface expression. Pressure activated SW620 FAK and Src, but not ERK. Manganese did not. Calcium-inhibited adhesion but stimulated FAK (but not Src). PP2 prevented pressure activation of Src, Src phosphorylation of FAK576, and pressure-stimulated adhesion but not FAK397 autophosphorylation. FRNK transfection or FAK SiRNA also prevented pressure-stimulated adhesion. FAK SiRNA ablated pressure-activated FAK397, Src, and FAK576 phosphorylation. Neither Src nor FAK inhibition blocked cation effects. Phalloidin prevented pressure-stimulated adhesion. PD98059 or calphostin C did not. Conclusions: In contrast to divalent cations, extracellular pressure may increase integrin affinity and promote colon cancer adhesion via actin dependent inside-out FAK and Src signals. This mechanotransduced pathway may regulate metastasizing tumor cell adhesion.},

  abstract = {Proper regulation of the formation and stabilization of epithelial cell\textendash cell adhesion is crucial in embryonic morphogenesis and tissue repair processes. Defects in this process lead to organ malformation and defective epithelial barrier function. A combination of chemical and mechanical cues is used by cells to drive this process. We have investigated the role of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and its connection to cell\textendash cell junction complexes in the formation of an epithelial barrier in MDCK cells. We find that the E-cadherin complex is sufficient to mediate a functional link between cell\textendash cell contacts and the actomyosin cytoskeleton. This link involves the actin binding capacity of {$\alpha$}-catenin and the recruitment of the mechanosensitive protein Vinculin to tensile, punctate cell\textendash cell junctions that connect to radial F-actin bundles, which we name Focal Adherens Junctions (FAJ). When cell\textendash cell adhesions mature, these FAJs disappear and linear junctions are formed that do not contain Vinculin. The rapid phase of barrier establishment (as measured by Trans Epithelial Electrical Resistance (TER)) correlates with the presence of FAJs. Moreover, the rate of barrier establishment is delayed when actomyosin contraction is blocked or when Vinculin recruitment to the Cadherin complex is prevented. Enhanced presence of Vinculin increases the rate of barrier formation. We conclude that E-cadherin-based FAJs connect forming cell\textendash cell adhesions to the contractile actomyosin cytoskeleton. These specialized junctions are sites of Cadherin mechanosensing, which, through the recruitment of Vinculin, is a driving force in epithelial barrier formation.},

  abstract = {The shapes of eukaryotic cells and, ultimately, the organisms that they form are defined by cycles of mechanosensing, mechanotransduction and mechanoresponse. Recent studies have shed light into the molecular mechanisms of local mechanosensing and how transduction into biochemical signals could result in whole-cell responses to substrate rigidity.Cellular mechanical phenomena can be described by sequential events: first, mechanosensing that involves a local molecular change in response to changes in force or in geometry (architecture of recognition sites); second, mechanotransduction that involves the conversion of force- or geometry-induced changes into biochemical signals; and third, mechanoresponses, which are changes in cellular function that involve integrated signal responses by motile systems in the short term, and by changes in the molecular composition of the cell in the long term.Force sensing involves the detection of local changes in protein conformation, including protein unfolding. Known mechanisms that are affected by force include opening ion channels, unfolding matrix proteins, cytoplasmic protein unfolding, alterations of enzyme kinetics and catch-bond formation.Geometry sensing involves the detection of the proper spacing of protein sites in clusters, as well as sensing changes in membrane curvature, or in the overall size of protein complexes.Mechanotransduction involves the activation of several signalling pathways, including, but not limited to, the small G proteins, trimeric G proteins, tyrosine phosphorylation, inositol lipid metabolism and calcium level.In tissue engineering, artificial environments have to be designed such that cells will go through different phases with time; however, modifications of the environment by cells pose an important, and complex, problem. The dynamic interplay between cells and their biological matrices over many cycles of mechanosensing, transduction, integrated cell response and matrix remodelling make it difficult to understand how cells know whether to grow, differentiate or undergo apoptosis.},

  abstract = {Talin, a force-bearing cytoplasmic adapter essential for integrin-mediated cell adhesion, links the actin cytoskeleton to integrin-based cell\textendash extracellular matrix adhesions at the plasma membrane. Its C-terminal rod domain, which contains 13 helical bundles, plays important roles in mechanosensing during cell adhesion and spreading. However, how the structural stability and transition kinetics of the 13 helical bundles of talin are utilized in the diverse talin-dependent mechanosensing processes remains poorly understood. Here we report the force-dependent unfolding and refolding kinetics of all talin rod domains. Using experimentally determined kinetics parameters, we determined the dynamics of force fluctuation during stretching of talin under physiologically relevant pulling speeds and experimentally measured extension fluctuation trajectories. Our results reveal that force-dependent stochastic unfolding and refolding of talin rod domains make talin a very effective force buffer that sets a physiological force range of only a few pNs in the talin-mediated force transmission pathway.},

  abstract = {Mechanosensing at focal adhesions regulates vital cellular processes. Here, we present results from molecular dynamics (MD) and mechano-biochemical network simulations that suggest a direct role of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) as a mechano-sensor. Tensile forces, propagating from the membrane through the PIP2 binding site of the FERM domain and from the cytoskeleton-anchored FAT domain, activate FAK by unlocking its central phosphorylation site (Tyr576/577) from the autoinhibitory FERM domain. Varying loading rates, pulling directions, and membrane PIP2 concentrations corroborate the specific opening of the FERM-kinase domain interface, due to its remarkably lower mechanical stability compared to the individual alpha-helical domains and the PIP2-FERM link. Analyzing downstream signaling networks provides further evidence for an intrinsic mechano-signaling role of FAK in broadcasting force signals through Ras to the nucleus. This distinguishes FAK from hitherto identified focal adhesion mechano-responsive molecules, allowing a new interpretation of cell stretching experiments.},
