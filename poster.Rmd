# Unstructured loop of Talin's FERM domain can serve as a flexible membrane anchor

This allows for interaction with PIP~2~ even in Talin's autoinhibited form
and paves the way to establish known binding surfaces.

<!-- # The **F1 loop** of the focal adhesion protein Talin can function as a flexible **membrane anchor** and perform initial PIP~2~ **recognition**. -->

## Abstract

![The autoinhibited (Cryo-EM) structure of Talin1 found by @deddenArchitectureTalin1Reveals2019a aligned with the structure of the FERM domain by @elliottStructureTalinHead2010 and the modelled flexible loop in F1 (darker cyan)](assets/blender/render-align/frame0000.png){.wrapping}

Focal adhesions mediate the interaction of the cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix (ECM).
Talin is a central regulator and adaptorprotein of the multiprotein focal adhesion complexes and is responsible for integrin activation and force-sensing.
We evaluated direct interactions of talin with the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP~2~) by means of molecular dynamics simulations.
A newly published autoinhibitory structure of talin, where common PIP~2~ interaction sites are covered up, sparked our curiosity for a hitherto less examined loop as a potential site of first contact.
We show that this unstructured loop in the F1 subdomain of the talin1 FERM domain is able to interact with PIP~2~ and can facilitate further interactions by serving as a flexible membrane anchor.

<!-- ## Rotational sampling reveals prominent loop--membrane interactions -->

![A rotational sampling of the F0F1 domain reaveals the strong propensity of the F1 loop to interact with the membrane. Even in the most unfavorable position, the loop still has a high probability to find the membrane and interact with PIP~2~ due to the large search space it can cover.](assets/results/plots/f0f1-ri-angle-npip-1.png){width=80% .center}

<p class="caption">**Left**: Once a certain number of residues are interacting, it becomes highly unlikely for F0F1 to dissociate from the membrane. **Right**: Pulling bound F0F1 off of the membrane does need some force, but the most important aspect for remaining bound is its flexibility. This allows it to remain in contact with PIP~2~ over a long period of time during pulling.</p>

![Once contact has been established via the loop, simulations with the full lenght FERM domain show that known PIP~2~ interaction sites are recovered. The location of binding surfaces found by @chinthalapudiInteractionTalinCell2018a are highlighted with red lines on the schematic: K272 of F2 and K316, K324, E342, and K343 of F3. Red arrows highlight the corresponding area in the FERM domain render.](assets/results/plots/ferm-ri-npip-1.png)
